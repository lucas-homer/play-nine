# Play-Nine
## from Samer Buna's Pluralsight course, "React.js: Getting Started"

During the course, we developed this game in one jsComplete React sandbox, 
so after finishing it, I started with create-react-app, separated the class component and functional components into actual component files and installed Bootstrap 4 and Font-Awesome, as those two packages were built into the jsComplete environment. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
